# Passion Project
CMS for hairstyle catalogue platform based on hair stylists’ portfolios


## Project idea
I created a CMS for an online hair style catalogue based on hair stylists’ portfolio. 
In the future, I would like to make a web application where people in Toronto can search for hair stylists and hair salon information where they belong to this catalogue. 
For this MVP, I am going to pretend that hair stylists create an account and post their portfolio pieces through the web application. 
This CMS manages hair salon information, hair stylists’ information as well as their portfolio pieces.

## FEATURES
